FLT3	P36888	FLT3_HUMAN	FLT3 CD135 FLK2 STK1	993	Receptor-type tyrosine-protein kinase FLT3 (EC 2.7.10.1) (FL cytokine receptor) (Fetal liver kinase-2) (FLK-2) (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) (FLT-3) (Stem cell tyrosine kinase 1) (STK-1) (CD antigen CD135)	DISEASE: Leukemia, acute myelogenous (AML) [MIM:601626]: A subtype of acute leukemia, a cancer of the white blood cells. AML is a malignant disease of bone marrow characterized by maturational arrest of hematopoietic precursors at an early stage of development. Clonal expansion of myeloid blasts occurs in bone marrow, blood, and other tissue. Myelogenous leukemias develop from changes in cells that normally produce neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils and monocytes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11090077, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11290608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11442493, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14504097, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16266983, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18305215, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8946930, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9737679}. Note=The gene represented in this entry may be involved in disease pathogenesis. Somatic mutations that lead to constitutive activation of FLT3 are frequent in AML patients. These mutations fall into two classes, the most common being in-frame internal tandem duplications of variable length in the juxtamembrane region that disrupt the normal regulation of the kinase activity. Likewise, point mutations in the activation loop of the kinase domain can result in a constitutively activated kinase.

Note=The disease is caused by variants affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Gastric cancer (GASC) [MIM:613659]: A malignant disease which starts in the stomach, can spread to the esophagus or the small intestine, and can extend through the stomach wall to nearby lymph nodes and organs. It also can metastasize to other parts of the body. The term gastric cancer or gastric carcinoma refers to adenocarcinoma of the stomach that accounts for most of all gastric malignant tumors. Two main histologic types are recognized, diffuse type and intestinal type carcinomas. Diffuse tumors are poorly differentiated infiltrating lesions, resulting in thickening of the stomach. In contrast, intestinal tumors are usually exophytic, often ulcerating, and associated with intestinal metaplasia of the stomach, most often observed in sporadic disease. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15273732, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25820570}.
